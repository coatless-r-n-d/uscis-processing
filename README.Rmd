The repository contains a study in programmatically obtaining
[processing time data](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/) for various 
immigration forms from the [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)](https://www.uscis.gov/)
using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). Historical
median processing information for the fiscal years is shared by USCIS at
<https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/historic-pt>

Information is obtained by making the same standard HTTPS requests the 
[processing time form](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/)
makes to communicate with the USCIS Processing Time API found at:

```
https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/api/
```

You can see an example of the workflow for obtaining the I-485 processing time 
data for Chicago, IL in the following GIF:

## Acknowledgements

### USCIS

I would like to take a moment to express my gratitude and appreciation to the USCIS team for their hard work and dedication in reviewing and processing immigration forms. Their tireless efforts help individuals and families from around the world to realize their dreams and build new lives in the United States. Thank you for your service to the community and for making a positive impact on so many lives.

### Prior work

Retrieved processing time information from the USCIS has been extensively studied, but there has been a lack of
focus on utilizing the R programming language for this purpose. For non-exhaustive examples of prior projects, please see:
